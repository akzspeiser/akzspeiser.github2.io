I have been attending Oregon State University since last fall and I love it there. I am a member of the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in the Engineering College at Oregon State. I will also be taking over as student body Senator of the School of EECS in the fall.
I just finished my Junior year double majoring in Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering but I don't plan on graduating for another two solid years.

## About My Project

We will be working with an autonomous underwater arm that we will be teaching how to pick things up from the simulated ocean floor. We will be submerging it in the wave pool at OSU and using test subjects to try and teach it to grasp things themselves. We will also be working to program drones to play "Blob Tag" where one drone is and sequentially touches another drone and they are linked and at a point, the multitude of drones splits in half. once all of the drones have been "blobbed" the game is over.
