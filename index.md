## About Me

Hello, I am **Zachary Ray Speiser**, but I go by **Zac**. I moved to Oregon about six years ago from Alaska and started school four years ago. I have been attending **Oregon State University** for two years now, and I love it here. I am a member of the **School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)** in the **College of Engineering** at Oregon State. I also serve as a **student body senator** for the College of Engineering.

I just finished my fourth year working towards a double major in **Computer Science** and **Electrical and Computer Engineering**. My email address is [akzspeiser@gmail.com](mailto:akzspeiser@gmail.com).

## About My Mentor

My mentor is **Dr. Heather Knight**, who specializes in robot entertainment. You can learn more about her work on her [website](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/heather-knight).

## About My Project

We are working on creating a dataset that combines spoken words and phrases with robotic movement data. This project involves several key steps:

### Project Details

1. **Task Description:** Participants will speak out the task they want the robot to perform.
2. **Verbal Instructions:** Participants will explain how they would ask the robot to perform the task in their own words.
3. **Manual Manipulation:** Participants will manually manipulate the robot to perform the task.
4. **Robot Execution:** The robot will then perform the task in front of the participants.
5. **Feedback Collection:** Participants will provide feedback on the robot's performance, explaining their thoughts in words.

This process will help us understand how humans communicate tasks to robots and how robots can better interpret and execute these tasks.
