This week I set up and installed ROS and Moveit using a virtual machine, I hope it works. I completed an online course necessary to gain access to the fabrication room with all the 3D printers and materials to fabricate what we are creating. I created a drawing of the seafloor bottom I will be creating. I worked on the first draft of my project pitch I will present soon. I also researched ways to make a continuous input device.
