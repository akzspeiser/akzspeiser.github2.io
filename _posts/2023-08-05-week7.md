This week has been spent testing the CID and tweaking the code to work right, I received some feedback from the member of my team who will be using it and made it to fit his needs. I had to modify my housing model to be thicker and printed a final copy this week, hopefully, this is the final print. I put the final coat of epoxy on the seabed floor and it's now out of my hands, what a relief. I spent a lot of time this week working on my final report and presentation coming up in a few weeks.
