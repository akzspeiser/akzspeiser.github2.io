I received a new hard drive and got everything installed. I was able to get Linux, ROS, and Movit installed and I have been learning how to use them. Everything went well at Hinsdale with seafloor and CID, I am ecstatic. I have been focusing mostly on getting my final report and presentation finished as I present it on Monday. One more week, yay!
