title: Week 5

We received parts for the seabed floor and I have cut them out to specification, I have also glued everything together with epoxy; the fiberglass should start next week. I am having trouble learning how to use Fusion 360 to get the model I found to work for what I need it to do. I may have to create my own model for the continuous input device. I can't get the microprocessor I ordered to work, I ordered a new one, and it should be here next week. I have an Arduino Uno working fine with the slide potentiometer and I have created code that works to send the signals to the COM port. I am having all kinds of trouble getting Linux and ROS installed. I am going to have to install it on another hard drive I think. I also worked on my mid-year presentation that is next Monday.
