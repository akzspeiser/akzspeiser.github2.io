title: Week 3

There has been a lot happening; I have been given 3 tasks. I am first creating an artificial seafloor that will be submerged in a wave pool. It needs to represent the bottom of the ocean with spaces for multiple objects to be placed and then an underwater robotic arm can try different grasps to learn which ones are feasible. Second, I am designing and building a continuous input device where the subject testing the grasp can give a real-time confidence value to each grasp. The third part of my summer internship is to use motion capture technology with a suit to gather data on how to program a Bravo 7 robotic arm to grasp objects underwater. I've completed the cutting of foam and plywood for the seabed along with the hardware fasteners. I've had access to a full metal/3D printing lab. I have all the parts for the sliding potentiometer that I will connect to a microprocessor via a Grove connection which connects to the PC via USB. I am also printing the housing that will fit the potentiometer.
