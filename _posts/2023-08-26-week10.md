I presented my project to the team and it went off without a hitch, Finally done (I can breathe). I struggle with getting the code to work with the Movit nodes to eventually use the Xsens suit we planned on using but I can move the robot. It has been a really fun summer, I learned a lot and I hope I can come back next summer.
