title: Week 4

This week I have been entrenched in the continuous input device design/build. I found an STL file where I can change the proportion to use as a housing for the device I am creating. I ordered an AtomS3U microprocessor to catch the input from a 120mm slide potentiometer. I ordered all the parts this week and should get them next week. I have been working out the specifications for the seabed floor and the parts were ordered and should be here next week as well.
