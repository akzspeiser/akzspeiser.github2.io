title: Week 6

I have finished building the seafloor bottom and I have encased it with fiberglass, the final coat goes on next week. I ended up just creating my own model for the continuous input device housing and printed it out but had to print both the top and bottom twice due to printer problems. I received the new microprocessor and everything works. I've been working all week on writing code to convert the values from the Arduino from 0 - 1023 into values from -100 to 100 and then saving the values to a file 8 times a second. I've also completed and presented my mid-year presentation.
