This week I handed off the CID (I hope it works out) and focused on the robot teleoperation part of my research. Everyone on my team is busy at Hinsdale (the wave pool) testing the robot this week so I get a break. The hard drive offered in the PC I was given doesn't seem to work and I need to install Linux on a separate drive. I am having a lot of problems due to my inexperience with Linux; I am having trouble even getting it installed at this point (I've installed everything 3 times now and my mentor isn't helping much.
