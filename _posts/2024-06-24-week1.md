# Week 1: Getting Started

## Re-familiarizing with the Robotics Lab and Team CHARISMA

Last week, my first week, I got re-familiarized with the robotics lab and met my new team, **Team CHARISMA**. We focused on getting the Franka plugin to work with ROS and control the robot. Although I didn't get that far yet, I have clear goals for the first three weeks: 

1. **Get the arm working**
2. **Obtain feedback data from the embedded force sensors**

## Challenges and Adjustments

Unfortunately, one of the members of our team caught COVID-19 and was around the rest of the team for a day on Friday, so we are going remote this week. This unexpected change means we need to adapt quickly and ensure our progress continues smoothly.

## Upcoming Tasks

Despite the challenges, I'm optimistic about the upcoming weeks. Here's what we're focusing on:

- **Remote Collaboration**: Coordinating with the team to continue our work remotely.
- **Franka Plugin and ROS**: Continuing to work on integrating the Franka plugin with ROS.
- **Force Sensor Data**: Starting to collect and analyze feedback data from the robotic arm's embedded force sensors.

I'll provide more updates and insights in the next post as we make progress on these tasks.

Stay tuned for more updates!
