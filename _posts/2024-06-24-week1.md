title: Week 1

We have just started and are still getting things set up. I will know more and have more to post after next week. It seems we may not be working with the robotic arm next week as yesterday it broke and needs to go back to Australia to get fixed. Washington State University has the exact arm but needs to use it so we may be driving up there to get data. In the meantime, I will be coding swarm robots to play "Blob Tag" and learning Robot Operating System.
